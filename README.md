I took on a personal challenge to complete 10 Projects in 10 Hours.

Was mainly "inspired" by a few similar approaches online and thought it would be rather fun to do.

# List of projects below

* **Countdown timer app**

    **Desired**

    Any user could input their prefered targeted date and the app will calculate and display a specific countdown timer for that event.

    **Start**

    At first only 1 fixed date will be hardcoded for demo purpose.
