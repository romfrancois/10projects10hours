I took on a personal challenge to complete 10 Projects in 10 Hours.

Was mainly "inspired" by a few similar approaches online and thought it would be rather fun to do.

# List of projects below

* **Countdown timer app**

    **Desired**

    Any user could input their prefered targeted date and the app will calculate and display a specific countdown timer for that event.

    **Start**

    At first only 1 fixed date will be hardcoded for demo purpose.

<br>

* **Quiz app**

    Very minimalist application that shows a series of 5 questions and let you know at the end how many you got right

<br>

* **Recipe app**

    Application that displays a random recipe; you can also search for one.
    Any can be added/removed as/from a favorite.

<br>

* **Movie app**

    Rather simple app that displays recent movies and allow you to check some details, like synopsis, rating, etc.
    Users can also search for a movie.

<br>

* **Weather app**

    Simple app that displays today's weather for any searched location.
    We could also imagine adding/deleting locations as desired and expand today's forecast to display the rest of the week

<br>

* **Card game app**

    Computer is drawing 2 cards from a deck; we compare the cards and get the score.
    At the end of the game we congratulate the winner.
